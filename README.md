### Getting-and-Cleanning-data

 Repo for the Project from the Getting and Cleanning Data course

### Overview

This project intends to demonstrate the importance and the ability to collect, work with and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data that cam be use for later analysis. The data was collected from the web site that can be found in the following address https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
  
  
 ### Project Summary

## Develop a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

    - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    - finally creates a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
    
 ## Also in the repo will be necessary to add the follow documentation
    
1) the R script run_analysis containing all the information 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
